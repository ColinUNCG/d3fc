  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
      <p><a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a> is a powerful and versatile tool for transforming data into visualisations using SVG, HTML and CSS. One reason why D3 is an ideal tool for creating charts is that you have complete control over how your data is rendered. Every tick mark, gridline, axis and datapoint is constructed manually using primitive elements.</p>

      <p>However, with D3 being a low-level tool you have to write quite a bit of code to generate even the simplest of charts.</p>

      <p>This is where <b>D3FC</b> comes in! This project provides a set of building blocks that allow you to assemble charts quickly and easily, without taking away the underlying power of D3. These components can be assembled, configured and styled with CSS to produce a whole range of different charts.</p>
