layout: default
title: Line Series
component: series/line.js
tags:
  - frontpage

example-code: |
  var point = fc.series.line()
      .xScale(xScale)
      .yScale(yScale);

  container.append('g')
      .datum(data)
      .call(point);

The point series renders the given data as a line, constructed from an SVG `path`:

{% highlight javascript %}
{{ page.example-code }}
{% endhighlight %}

Which gives the following:

{% include exampleFixture.html %}

This series has the same properties for specifying the x and y value accessors, and decorate as the [point series](#point).
